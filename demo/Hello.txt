Any Python user who needs to download your objects has either google-crc32c or crcmod installed.

Any gsutil user who needs to download your objects has crcmod installed.

For example, if you use gsutil to upload video assets that are only served by a Java application, parallel composite uploads are a good choice because there are efficient CRC32C implementations available in Java.

You do not need the uploaded objects to have an MD5 hash.
